Receive an email when a new post is created in bbPress via BuddyPress

== Description ==

Extend the features of a BuddyPress and bbPress installation. When a new topic is created in a BuddyPress Group, all members of the group will receive an email notification about the new topic. When new replies are added to the topic, anyone who has posted in that topic will receive an email to notify them about the new post.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of BuddyPress is needed? =

This plugin was tested with version 1.0.3 of BuddyPress.

= Can user elect to not get the email? =

No, there is not an opt out feature.  I hope to add that in future releases.

= Why would I install this? =

If you are using BuddyPress and bbPress together, members currently must check to see when new topics or posts are created in a member group.  This plugin sends them a detailed email about the new post.  This will drive up the activity on your group forums.
